<h1>Installation</h1>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Interpreter of the <a href="http://ruby-lang.org">Ruby language</a> is
needed to run cuby. Often, it comes as a part of the system, otherwise,
it can be <a href="ruby_installation.html">installed</a> easily.</p>
<p>Ruby version 1.8 is sufficient to run cuby but it is substantially slower
than version 1.9 which we strongly recommend. Cuby works with Ruby 2.0 as well
but it has not been fully tested yet.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>The installation can be as simple as just unpacking the archive in a
directory of your choice. It creates a directory cuby4 which contains the
Cuby framework. To test the installation, go to the cuby4 directory and type</p>
<pre><code>./cuby4 --info</code></pre>
<p>to get some basic information on the current installation. To test whether
cuby works, you can run a simple calculation with a command</p>
<pre><code>./cuby4 --test</code></pre>
<p>To run your own calculation, run cuby on an input file:</p>
<pre><code>install_path/cuby4 input_file.yaml</code></pre>

<h2>Environment setup</h2>
<p>To make cuby accessible from anywhere, add the path to the installation
to the PATH environment variable. In bash, use command:</p>
<pre><code>export PATH=your_install_path:$PATH</code></pre>
<p>Add this command to your ~/.bashrc file to make this setup permanent.</p>

<h2>Configuration file</h2>
<p>The configuration of cuby, most importantly the paths to all the
extarnal software it uses, can be stored in a config file (It is not necessary
as every calculation can be configured in the input file).</p>
<p>The config file is a list of key-value pairs in YAML format; the value overwrites
the default value of the respective keyword. An example of a config file can be found
in cuby_directory/config.</p>
<p>Two config files can be used:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A global one named cuby4_config.yaml, located
	<strong>at the same level as the cuby4 directory</strong> (e.g when the cuby4 exacutable
	is ~/cuby4/cuby4, the config file is ~/cuby4_config.yaml). This location was chosen
	so that the config file is preserved when the cuby4 directory is overwritten.
	This configuration applies to all users.</li>
	<li>A local one (named ~/.cuby4). Each user can have its own local config file
	and it overrides the setup from the global config.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Binary extensions</h2>
<p>While Cuby is written in pure ruby, it will run faster when the most
demanding tasks are offloaded to binary extensions. There are two of them,
one for represetnation of the molecular coordinates and a second one
implementing matrix and vector algebra.</p>
<p>To compile the extensions, a C compiler, ruby header files and ruby's mkmf
tool are needed. In debian-based Linux distributions, the the headers and mkmf
are found in the ruby1.X-dev package.</p>
<p>To compile the linear algebra extension, blas and lapack libraries and
their header files have to be present (packages libblas-dev, liblapack-dev
on debian-based Linux). Manual installation of the dependencies is <a href="installation_libraries.html">described here</a>.</p>
<p>Some advanced optimization algorithms require the UMFPACK
library (part of the <a href="http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html">Suitesparse</a> package) but the extension can be compiled and used without it. This is the only functionality of the extensions that does not have a ruby equivalent because it is intended for applications to large systems where ruby code would be too slow.</p>
<p>Once you have installed all the dependencies, run</p>
<pre><code>./cuby4 --make</code></pre>
<p>to compile the extensions. Sometimes, lapack is not identfied automatically even if it
present. To override the autodetection, compile the extensions with:</p>
<pre><code>./cuby4 --make-force</code></pre>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Provided all the dependencies are available, the following series of
commands (bash shell is assumed) installs cuby so that it is ready to use:</p>
<pre><code>tar -xf cuby4.tgz
cd cuby4
export PATH=`pwd`:$PATH
echo "export PATH=`pwd`:\$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
cp config/keyword_defaults.yaml ../cuby4_config.yaml
cuby4 --make
cuby4 --info
cuby4 --test
</code></pre>
