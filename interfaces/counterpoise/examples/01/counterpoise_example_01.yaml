# Counterpoise example 1: energy calculation
#===============================================================================

# Counterpoise-corrected energy calculation
job: energy
interface: counterpoise

# The calculation method has to be specified in a separate block,
# note that the keyword "job" is not present
calculation:
  interface: turbomole
  method: HF
  basisset: SVP

# Water dimer from Cuby's database
geometry: A24:water_dimer
charge: 0

# The energy components list also the uncorrected energy
# and corerc ted and uncorrected interaction energies:
print: energy_decomposition

# The following input is optional in this case as cuby can find the two
# moelcules automatically and in the case of neutral singlet dimer, it assumes
# them to be neutral singlets too
molecule_a:
  selection: 1-3
  charge: 0
  multiplicity: 1
molecule_b:
  selection: 4-6
  charge: 0
  multiplicity: 1
