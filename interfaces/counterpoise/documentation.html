Implementation of the Boys and Bernardi counterpoise correction[1] for basis set superposition error. This interface implements it for the total energy and its derivatives, five calculations are required to isolate the BSSE and remove it. For counterpoise-corrected calculations of interaction energy, use the option <a href="keywords.html#bsse_correction">bsse_correction</a> in the <a href="protocol_interaction.html">interaction</a> protocol as it is more efficient (only three calculations are needed).
