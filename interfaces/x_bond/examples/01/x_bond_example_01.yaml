# Geometry optimization of a halogen-bonded complex of bromobenzene with
# acetone using the PM6-D3H4X method (PM6 with empirical corrections
# for dispersion, hydrogen bonds and halogen bonds)


# Optimization setup
job: optimize
opt_quality: 0.1
optimizer: rfo

# PM6 in mopac
method: pm6
interface: mopac
mopac_precise: yes # For such optimization, accurate gradients are needed

# The corrections: D3, H4 and X
modifiers: dispersion3, h_bonds4, x_bond

# The geometry is taken from the X40 dataset, entry #20
geometry: X40:20
