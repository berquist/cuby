Interface to the Psi4 quantum chemistry package (<a href="http://www.psicode.org/">www.psicode.org</a>, open source).
Psi4 offers modern implementation of wide range of QM methods.

<p>
For now, the interface provides access to the basic wavefunction QM methods (including the FNO approximation) and to SAPT.
