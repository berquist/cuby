# Psi4 interface example 3 - SAPT
#===============================================================================

# This input demonstrates how to run a SAPT calculation, it requires some
# specific input.

interface: psi4

# Although interaction energy is calculated, it is done in a single run of
# the external program, called by the "energy" protocol
job: energy

geometry: S66:water_dimer # Water dimer from the S66 data set
charge: 0

method: sapt
# Order of the SAPT expansion - SAPT0 is the most approximate level available:
psi4_sapt_level: sapt0

basisset: aug-cc-pVDZ
density_fitting: both

# The information on the fragments (monomers) to be passed to Psi4:
psi4_geometry_fragments: yes
molecule_a:
  charge: 0
  multiplicity: 1
  selection: "1-3"
molecule_b:
  charge: 0
  multiplicity: 1
  selection: "4-6"

# To get the components of the interaction energy, enable their printing:
print: energy_decomposition
