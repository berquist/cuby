# H-bonds4 example 1: Interaction energy calculation with PM6-D3H4
#===============================================================================

# In this example, the D3 and H4 corrections (designed to be used together)
# are added to PM6 in calculation of interaction energy

job: interaction
method: pm6
interface: mopac

# This interface is called as a modifier, its result is added to the underlying
# PM6 calculation performed in MOPAC
modifiers: dispersion3, h_bonds4
# No setup for the modifiers is needed, the default parameters are identified
# and applied automagically.

# Geometry: Water dimer from the S66 data set
geometry: S66:water_dimer
charge: 0

# Print energy components, in this case the contributions of the corrections
print: energy_decomposition

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Note
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This calculation prints a warning on selection in non-PDB file. This is
# because the H4 correction contains a special term applied to charged residues
# which can be identified only when the input is a PDB file.
