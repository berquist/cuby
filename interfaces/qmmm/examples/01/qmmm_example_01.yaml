# QMMM example 1 - simple QM/MM calculation
#===============================================================================

# Very little setup is needed when the QM region is a separate molecule. Here,
# a water dimer is calculated, the first water is QM and the second is MM.

job: optimize

geometry: water_dimer.pdb

interface: qmmm

# Electrostatic embedding:
qmmm_embedding: electrostatic_2way

# Definition of the QM region - the first residue is QM

# Setup of the QM calculation

# Setup for the MM calculation, shared by both the calculation of the whole system
# and the MM calculation of the QM region
