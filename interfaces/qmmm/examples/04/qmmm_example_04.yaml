#===============================================================================
# QMMM example 4 - Advanced MM settings
#===============================================================================

# This example is identical to Example 2 but additional setup ui used for
# the MM calculations

# This is the same as in example 2:
job: optimize
optimizer: rfo
opt_quality: 0.5
maxcycles: 500

geometry: ace-ala-nme.pdb

interface: qmmm

qmmm_embedding: electrostatic_2way
qmmm_remove_charges: "16,17"

qmmm_core: 1-14
qmmm_cut_bonds:
  - {bond: 9-15, link_ratio: 0.729, link_type: HL}
qmmm_rename_residues:
  - ":2 ala"

calculation_qm:
  interface: turbomole
  method: dft
  basisset: SVP
  functional: b-lyp
  charge: 0

# Common MM setup used for the calculations of both the QM region and
# the whole system
calculation_mm:
  interface: amber
  # Here, we use the unmodified ff03 forcefield
  amber_leaprc: "%amberhome/dat/leap/cmd/leaprc.ff03.r1"

# Setup for the MM calculation of the QM region
calculation_qmregion_mm:
  # Here, we load the customized forcefield for the QM region,
  # it overrides the settings in block 'calculation_mm'
  amber_leaprc: leaprc.ala

# Setup for the MM calculation of the whole system
calculation_system_mm:
  # Use implicit solvent. This is a crude approximation as the
  # solvent does not affect the QM calculation in other way than mechanically
  # but it is an useful tool to keep the native structure of larger biomolecules
  solvent_model: GBM
