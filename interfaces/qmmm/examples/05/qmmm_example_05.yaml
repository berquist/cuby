# QMMM example 5 - Automated fragmentation
#===============================================================================

# The QM/MM interface can automatically prepare QMMM calculation of a peptide,
# adding caps to the broken backbone. The initial selection of the QM region
# should contain the region of interest which is then enlarged as needed:
# 1) Complete residues included in the selection are used
# 2) No other bonds than peptide bonds in the peptide chain can be broken
# 3) Capping residues are added to terminate the broken peptide bonds

job: energy
interface: qmmm
geometry: trpcage.pdb

# Switch on automated fragmentation
qmmm_auto_fragmentation: peptide_backbone

# Here, we define what we want in the QM region. This selection is then extended
# automatically so that the peptide backbone is properly capped capped.

  # The following leaprc packaged with cuby loads the Amber ff03 with definition
  # of the cap redidues needed

# With this input, cuby will run the calculation immediately. If you want to check
# the generated setup and QM region geometry, set the following keyword to 'no'.
