# QMMM example 2 - QMMM boundary across a covalent bond
#===============================================================================

# When a covalent bond is cut, it is capped by a hydrogen link atom. In the input,
# it is necessary to define which bond is cut and what is the position and name
# of the link atom, it is then built automatically.

# The MM forcefield has to be able to describe the QM region, in this case,
# it was necessary to crate a new residue for the alanine sidechain.
