<p>
This interface offers a partial implementation of the Universal Force Field (UFF)[1],
making it possible to carry out simplie calculations in Cuby without any external software.
It is useful for testing and demonstration purposes.
</p>

<p>
The implementation has following limitations:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Works only for limited set of elements: H,C,N and O</li>
	<li>Atomic charges are estimated using different method[2] that in original UFF</li>
</ul>
