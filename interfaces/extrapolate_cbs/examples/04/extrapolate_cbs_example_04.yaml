  # In this case, we override the commmon setup to use cfour interface,
  # cfour is one of the few packages that implement CCSD(T) gradient
  interface: cfour

# In addition to the CCSD(T) calculation, a MP2 calculation with the
# same setup is needed to calculate the correction which is defined
# as CCSD(T) - MP2
calculation_corr_mp2:
  # For consistency, this calculation has to use the same interface
  # as the CCSD(T) one
