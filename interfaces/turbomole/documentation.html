<p>
Interface to the Turbomole computational chemistry package
(<a href="http://www.turbomole-gmbh.com">www.turbomole-gmbh.com</a>, commercial software).
Turbomole provides very fast implementation of DFT and wavefunction methods.

<h4>Warning</h4>
<p>
Construction of the inputs for turbomole is difficult and problems may appear
when moving to different version of turbomole. Moreover, some problems may
get unnoticed as the calculation can run successfully, ignoring some part
of the input. It is recommended to check the turbomole outputs manually
for each type of calculation before production calculations.
