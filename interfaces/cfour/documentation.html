Interface to the CFOUR program package
(<a href="http://www.cfour.de">www.cfour.de</a>, free for academic use).
CFOUR (Coupled-Cluster techniques for Computational Chemistry) package implements high-level QM calculations. An important feature is the availability of analytic first and second energy derivatives for the coupled clusters methods.
</p>

<p>The interface was developed and tested with version 1 of CFOUR. For CCSD and CCSD(T) calculations, externally provided <a href="http://www.mrcc.hu/">MRCC</a> program can be used.</p>
