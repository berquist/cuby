<p>Spherical boundary potential for MD simulations in water. The interface implements only the mechanical
component of the potential of Beglov & Roux[1] which uses adaptive sphere radius to maintain
a constant pressure of 1 atmosphere. The electrostatic interaction of the solvent with the cavity is not
calculated, nor is the angular correction described in the paper. Even this
partial implementation yields results sufficient for use. The electrostatics can be
covered by using a suitable implicit solvent model in the underlying calculation</p>
