<p>
Interface to the AMBER molecular dynamics package
(<a href="http://ambermd.org">http://ambermd.org</a>, commercial software).
It provides MM calculations using the AMBER family of forcefields.
</p>

<p>
Besides performing the MM calculations, the interface also handles the preparation of the calculation from
a PDB file. The PDB file must be in a format recognized by AMBER and if it contains residues not
included in the forcefield, additional parameter files have to be provided.
