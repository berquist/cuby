# Amber example 6: Use of external point charges
#===============================================================================

# Geometry optimization of a water molecule in external electric field created
# by two point charges along the x axis. In the optimization, the molecule
# aligns with the field.

job: optimize
interface: amber

geometry: water.pdb

remove_translation: yes
remove_rotation: no
# Allow rotation, by default both translational and rotational components of
# the gradient are removed.
