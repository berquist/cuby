# Amber example 4: Solvation
#===============================================================================

# In this example, solvation energy is calculated as a difference between
# a calculation using implicit solvent and another gas phase calculation.
# To get the result from a single cuby job, composite interface mixer is
# used to run both calculations in parallel and subtract the results.

job: energy
interface: mixer

geometry: ../02/ace-ala-nme.pdb

print: energy_decomposition
# print components of the final energy, in this case energies of the two
# separate calculation (optional)

cuby_threads: 2
# run the two separate calculation in parallel (optional)

mixer_weight_a:  1.0
mixer_weight_b: -1.0
# This defines the weights (wA, wB) of the calculations, the resulting energy
# is then E = wA * E(A) + wB * E(B)

# The two calculations are defined as separate blocks of the input (the block
# name comes first, the contents of the block are then indented).

calculation_a: # Calculation in implicit solvent (GBM)
  interface: amber
  solvent_model: gbm
  # here, the solvent model is defined, the possible options are gbm and igb7
  # dilelectric constant can be specified by keyword solvent_epsilon,
  # the value of 78.5 (water) is used by default

calculation_b:
  interface: amber
  # amber calculation, everything set to default
