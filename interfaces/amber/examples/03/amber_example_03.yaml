# Amber example 3: Getting atomic charges
#===============================================================================

# The interface can be used to extract atomic charges from the forcefield
# for the calculated system. The input is the same as for a real calculation
# of the charges by other methods.

atomic_charges: forcefield
# The type of the charges must be provided, in this case "forcefield" is
