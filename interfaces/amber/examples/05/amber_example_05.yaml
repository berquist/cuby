# Amber example 5: Using a user-modified forcefield
#===============================================================================

# Geometry optimization of a peptide using an forcefield with a new
# residue defined by the user

# This example assumes that the interface is already configured, and uses some
# default values - see example 1 for reference. 

job: energy
interface: amber

geometry: peptide-fma.pdb
# The geometry contains a residue not defined in the forcefield - formic acid,
# residue name 'fma'

amber_leaprc: leaprc.my
# We use a custom leaprc file that
# 1) loads the amber forcefield for the peptide part
# 2) loads the gaff forcefield for general organic molecules
# 3) adds parameters missing in the gaff forcefileld - the frcmod file
# 4) loads the template for the 'fma' residue - a mol2 file
#    this file also contains the atomic charges for this molecule

# AN IMPORTANT FEATURE is used here: every leaprc file is preprocessed
# by cuby and following patterns are replaced with actual paths:
# %amberhome (path to amber installation)
# %home (path to home directory)
# %cuby (path to cuby inctallation)
# %pwd (path curernt working directory)
# This allows easy construction of portable leaprc files combining
# data from different sources.

# The parameters for an unknown molecule can be generated by the
# antechamber program packaged with AMBER, see the documentation for more
# information.
