# Cuby interface example 2 - dataset calculation using queue system
#===============================================================================

# This example is identical to Example 1 but the child jobs are prepared
# for running in a queue system. When they are run in step 2, they are not
# executed in series but submitted to the queue system and can run
# simultaneously on a cluster. The user has to wait for all the jobs to finish
# before running step 3.

# Dataset calculation
job: dataset
dataset: A24

# When results (in this case calculated externally) are found,
# read them instead of running the calculation.
existing_calc_dir: read_results
job_cleanup: no

# Cuby interface is used as an intermediate layer between
# the protocol and the calculation itself. This allows us to prepare
# the child calculations as cuby inputs.
interface: cuby

# The calculation is defined in a separate block

  interface: mopac
  method: pm6
  # Make the child jobs run in SGE queue
