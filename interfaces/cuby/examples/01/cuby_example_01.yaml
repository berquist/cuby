# Cuby interface example 1 - dataset calculation
#===============================================================================

# This example shows how to break a dataset calculation into individual jobs
# and read their results back into cuby. It is achieved in three steps:
#
# 1) Prepare the calculations without running them, using the -p option
#    that sets the keyword prepare_only:
#    cuby4 -p yes cuby_example_01.yaml
#
# 2) Run all the calculations prepared in step 1 in cuby, e.g. (in bash):
#    for i in *_CUBY; do cd $i; cuby4 cuby_input.yaml; cd ..; done
#
# 3) Run this input again to collect and process the results:
#    cuby4 cuby_example_01.yaml

# Dataset calculation
job: dataset
dataset: A24

# When results (in this case calculated externally) are found,
# read them instead of running the calculation.
existing_calc_dir: read_results
job_cleanup: no

# Cuby interface is used as an intermediate layer between
# the protocol and the calculation itself. This allows us to prepare
# the child calculations as cuby inputs.
interface: cuby

# The calculation is defined in a separate block
