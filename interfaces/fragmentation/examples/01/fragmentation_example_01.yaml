# Calculation of butane molecule which is built from three fragments -
# CH4, C2H6 and CH4.

# The PM6 calculation of this system yields energy 14.413 kcal/mol
# This fragmented calculation yields               14.436 kcal/mol

job: energy
interface: fragmentation

geometry: butane.xyz

# The bonds to be cut (two atom selections) and a ratio determining the length of
# the bond to the link atom (C-H) from the length of the original C-C bond.
fragmentation_cut_bonds: 
  - "11; 12; 0.7211"
  - "13; 14; 0.7211"

# If the following lines are uncommented, the fragments and their dimers are built
# and saved but no calculation is run on them:
#prepare_only: yes
#fragmentation_geometry_only: yes

# Method of calculation applied to the fragments is specified in a separate
# block:
calculation:
  method: pm6
  charge: 0
