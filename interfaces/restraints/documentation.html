<p>
This interface applies user-defined harmonic potentials between selected atoms or group of atoms.
Used as a modifier, it adds restraints to the underlying calculations. The restraints
can be applied to following internal coordinates (for detailed syntax, see the examples below):
<ul>
	<li><strong>distance</strong> - distance between two atoms</li>
	<li><strong>distance_f</strong> - the same as distance, potential with flat bottom</li>
	<li><strong>angle</strong> - angle between three atoms</li>
	<li><strong>torsion</strong> - torsional angle between four atoms</li>
	<li><strong>distance_difference</strong> - difference between two interatomic distances</li>
</ul>
