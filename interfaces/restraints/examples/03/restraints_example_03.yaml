# Restraints example 3: Flat-bottom distance restraint
#===============================================================================

# Molecular dynamics of water dimer, the dimer is prevented from dissociating
# by applying a restraint that has a flat bottom but adds a harmotic potential
# above a thershold distance.

job: dynamics
# NVT at 1000K, at this temperature the dimer will dissociate quickly
# when the restraint is not applied
thermostat: berendsen
temperature: 1000 # target temperature for the thermostat, K
init_temp: 1000 # initialization temperature, K
maxcycles: 10000
trajectory_freq: 50

interface: water_ff # Simple forcefield for water, built in in Cuby

geometry: S66:01 # Optimized water dimer from the S66 database

modifiers: restraints # This adds a modifier to the calculation specified above

# Each modifier has its own block (subsection) in the input, named
# modifier_[modifier_name]. The contents of a block are indented to distinguish
# it from the remainder of the input.

modifier_restraints:
  # The setup of the modifier comes here - a restraint is defined
  # The third number (8.0) is the additional parameter, below this distance
  # no restraint is applied.
  restraints:
    - distance_f; 5.0; 20.0; 8.0; 1-3; 4-6
