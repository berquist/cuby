# Restraints example 2: Restraint as a modifier, acting on more atoms
#===============================================================================

# Optimization of water dimer, with restraint on the distance between the
# molecules. When more atoms are used as the restraint centers, the additional
# potential acts on their center of mass.

job: optimize

interface: water_ff # Simple forcefield for water, built in in Cuby

geometry: S66:01 # Optimized water dimer from the S66 database

modifiers: restraints # This adds a modifier to the calculation specified above

# Each modifier has its own block (subsection) in the input, named
# modifier_[modifier_name]. The contents of a block are indented to distinguish
# it from the remainder of the input.

modifier_restraints:
  # The setup of the modifier comes here - a restraint is defined
  # The two molecules are defined by atom selections (using difefrent way for
  # each of them - "1-3" and "4,5,6")
  restraints:
    - distance; 5.0; 20.0; 1-3; 4,5,6
