# Restraints example 1: restraints syntax
#===============================================================================

# Here, the restraints are used as a standalone iterface, although the most
# common application of this interface is to use it as a modifier added to
# some other calculation. The purpose of this example is to demonstrate the
# syntax used to define all types of the restraints.

# Using the retsraints, we define a simple harmonic forcefield for a hydrogen
# peroxide, and optimize a very bad starting geometry using this forfecield.

job: optimize
interface: restraints

# Geometry - practically random guess

# The list of the restraints is an array in the YAML syntax (indented lines
# starting with "-"). Each line contain multiple entries, separated by
# semicolons:
# 1)       type of the internal coordinate (distance, angle, torsion)
# 2)       equilibrium value (in Angstroms/degrees)
# 3)       force constant (kcal/mol/Angstrom, kcal/mol/rad)
# 4,5,...) list of atoms (in Cuby selection syntax) defining the center the 
#          restraint is applied to (2 for distance, 3 for angle, 4 for torsion)
restraints:
  - distance; 0.95; 10; 1; 2
  - distance; 1.47; 10; 2; 3
  - distance; 0.95; 10; 3; 4
  - angle; 94.8; 10; 1; 2; 3
  - angle; 94.8; 10; 2; 3; 4
  - torsion; 111.5; 10; 1; 2; 3; 4
