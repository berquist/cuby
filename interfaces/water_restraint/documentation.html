Modifier for QM/MM MD simulations, prevents mixing of QM waters around the defined
solute with MM bulk waters. At the beginning of the simulations, specified number
of water molecules cosest to the solute is tagged as QM waters. If this QM water
moves farther than the closest bulk water, a harmonic restraint is applied to pull
the QM water back towards the solute.
