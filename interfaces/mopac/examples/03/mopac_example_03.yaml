# Mopac example 3: COSMO solvation and custom input
#===============================================================================

# Energy calculation in the COSMO solvent model. Additional option not
# accessible through cuby input is set using the mopac_keywords keyword.

# PM6 calculation in MOPAC
job: energy
interface: mopac
method: pm6

# Geometry: water molecule from the database
Geometry: A24:water

# Solvation
solvent_model: cosmo
solvent_epsilon: 80.0

# Extra setup: solvent radius (see http://openmopac.net/manual/rsolv.html)
# This option can not be set using a cuby keyword. However, any MOPAC options
# can be passed to the calculation. The value of the following keyword is
# appended to the header of the mopac input file constructed by cuby:
mopac_keywords: "RSOLV=1.20"
# (multiple options can be set, separated by spaces, as in the mopac input)
