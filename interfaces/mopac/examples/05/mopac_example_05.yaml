# Mopac example 5: Corrections for noncovalent interactions
#===============================================================================

# Calculation of interaction energy in water dimer with PM6 augmented with
# various versions of corrections for dispersion and hydrogen bonding, and
# with PM7:
# * PM6 without modifications
# * PM6-DH2
# * PM6-DH+
# * PM6-D3H4 (the latest version, most recommended)
# * PM7

# Multiple calculations are executed using the multistep job
job: multistep
# These are names of the steps:
steps: pm6, pm6-dh2, pm6-dh+, pm6-d3h4, pm7

# Setup shared by all the clculations - definition of PM6 interaction
# energy calculation

# Each step has its own subsection named calculation_stepname

# PM6: Subsection not needed, common setup is used

# PM6-DH2: corrections implemented in MOPAC are used
calculation_pm6-dh2:
  mopac_corrections: dh2

# PM6-DH+: corrections implemented in MOPAC are used
calculation_pm6-dh+:
  mopac_corrections: dh+

# PM6-D3H4: corrections implemented in cuby are used as modifiers
calculation_pm6-d3h4:
  modifiers: dispersion3, h_bonds4

# PM7: Specifying PM7 method overrides the common setup
calculation_pm6:
  method: pm7
