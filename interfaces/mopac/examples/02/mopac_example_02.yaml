# Mopac example 2: geometry optimization using the MOZYME acceleration
#===============================================================================

# Geometry optimization using the default setup:
job: optimize

# PM6 method in MOPAC
interface: mopac
method: pm6

# To accelerate the calculation, the MOZYME algorithm is used in MOPAC. It is
# not useful in such a small model system but becomes important in large
# molecules. (see MOPAC documentation: http://openmopac.net/manual/mozyme.html)
mopac_mozyme: yes
# By default, MOPAC, provides only approximate gradients, make them more accurate:
mopac_precise: yes

# Geometry: ethylene molecule, inline input

# In some cases (not here, the ethylene is used only as a demonstration),
# MOPAC fails to guess the Lewis structure of the molecule needed in the MOZYME
# calculation. This can be remediated by a manual input of either atomic charges
# or specification of pi bonds.

# In this case, we define the double bond between the carbons (atoms 5 and 6)
mopac_setpi:
  - 5;6

# and the charge of the first atom (hydrogen)
mopac_setcharge:
  1: 0
