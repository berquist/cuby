<p>Interface to the MOPAC package version 2012 (<a href="http://openmopac.net/">http://openmopac.net</a>,
free for academic use). MOPAC implements wide range of semiempirical methods and features the linear scaling
algorithm MOZYME[1] (see Example 2).</p>

<h2>Other versions</h2>
<p>
MOPAC 2009 will work with the interface but some features might not be available.
</p>

<p>
It is possible to use the public domain version,  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mopac7">MOPAC 7</a>, but the support by the interface is very limited. This mode has to be switched on using the <a href="keywords.html#mopac_version">mopac_version</a> keyword. So far, only single-point AM1 calculations were tested. Moreover, MOPAC 7 can not read cartesian geometry for small molecules, therefore the interface supports only molecules with at least 4 atoms.
