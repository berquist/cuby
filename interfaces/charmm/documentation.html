<p>
Interface to the CHARMM molecular dynamics package
(<a href="http://www.charmm.org">www.charmm.org</a>, commercial software).
The interface was developed for version c35b3, it have not been tested with other versions of CHARMM.
</p>

<p>
Besides performing the MM calculations, the interface also handles the preparation of the calculation from
a PDB file. This functionality is demonstrated in the following examples.
The PDB file must be in a format recognized by CHARMM and if it contains residues not
included in the CHARMM forcefield, additional parameter files have to be provided.
