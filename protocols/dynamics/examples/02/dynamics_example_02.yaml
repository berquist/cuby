# Molecular dynamics example 2 - restarting the simulation
#===============================================================================

# This example demonstrates restarting a MD run

job: multistep
steps: first, second

calculation_first:
  job: dynamics
  maxcycles: 100
  # Amber calculation of ace-ala-nme tripeptide from database
  interface: amber
  geometry: ace-xxx-nme:ala
  # By default, the simulation starts with random velocities generated from
  # the Boltzmann distribution
  init_temp: 600 
  # Every MD run produces file 'last.xyz' containing the final geometry and
  # velocities. Alternatively (e.g. if the run did not finish), a snapshot from
  # the trajectory can be used instead
  trajectory_file: trajectory1.xyz

calculation_second:
  # The same setup as in previous step
  job: dynamics
  maxcycles: 100
  interface: amber
  # Geometry for amber must be read from a PDB file, we can't use last.xyz directly
  # Therefore, we load the original geometry and update coordinates from the
  # restart file.
  geometry: ace-xxx-nme:ala
  geometry_update_coordinates: last.xyz
  # Velocities are read from the restart as well:
  velocities: read
  velocities_file: last.xyz
  # Write to second trajectory file
  trajectory_file: trajectory2.xyz

# The two trajectories produced should be equivalent to running a single,
# longer MD simulation
