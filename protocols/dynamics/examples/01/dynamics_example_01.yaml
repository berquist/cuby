# 1 ps of MD simulation (the default step is 1 fs)
job: dynamics
maxcycles: 1000

# Amber calculation of ace-ala-nme tripeptide from database
interface: amber
geometry: ace-xxx-nme:ala

# Initial temperature - used only to generate the velocities at the start
# of the simulation

# Because we start from optimized structure, this temperature is set to
# twice the desired temperature (100K) - the kinetic energy quickly equalizes
# with potential energy. If we started from a MD snapshot where we already
# have the potential energy, this will be set to teh actual temperature
# we want, it is 100 K.
init_temp: 200

# Thermostat
thermostat: berendsen
thermostat_tc: 0.1 # faster coupling needed for such a short simulation

# This is the temperature maintained by the thermostat
temperature: 100

# Optionally, the thermostated temperature can vary during the simulation.
# Uncomment the following keyword to perform a simulation where the system is
# gradually heated to 300 K over the course of the simulation.
temperature_target: 300
