<p>
This protocol calculates standard heat of formation of a molecule, &Delta;<sub>f</sub>H<sup>O</sup>(298.15 K). It calls a harmonic vibrational calculation that provides the ZPVE and other thermodynamic contributions, and energy calculations of the molecule and the atoms it constitutes of.
</p>

<p>
To account for standard states of the elements, tabulated data are used. The complete procedure is described in ref. [1].
