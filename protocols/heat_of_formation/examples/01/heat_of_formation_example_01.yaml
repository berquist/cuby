# Heat of formation calculation example
#===============================================================================

# A complete calculation o heat of formation of a methane
# Fast DFT calculatiosn are used for demonstration

# Multistep protocol is used to optimize the moleculle before the
# thermochemistry calculation (which includes vibrational analysis)
job: multistep
steps: opt, thermo

# The same method is used for optimization end frequencies,
# here it is defined only one
shared_method: &method_setup
  interface: turbomole
  method: dft
  functional: b3-lyp
  basisset: def2-SVP
  charge: 0

# Geometry optimization step
