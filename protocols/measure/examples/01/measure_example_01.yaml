# Measurements on a benzene-ethylene complex

job: measure
geometry: scan.xyz # The file contains five geometries

# The list of measurements as name: expression pairs
# The name is printed in the output
# In the expressions, semicolons separate the arguments (atom selections)
measurements: 
  # Distance between two atoms
  dist_3_16: distance(3; 16) 
  # Distance between the centers of molecules
  dist_cc: distance(1-12; 13-18) 
  # Closest distance between molecules
  closest: closest_distance(%molecule(1); %molecule(2)) 
  # Angle between two atoms and a center of group atoms
  angle: angle(9; 3; 16,17,18)
  # Torsion angle
  torsion: torsion(9; 3; 16; 18)
  # Point - plane distance between the benzene ring and the other molecule
  # First argument is the point (center of molecule), remaining three define the plane
  point_plane: point_plane(13-18; 1; 5; 9)
  # Point-normal vector distance, takes arguments P,A,B,C
  # Calculates distance of P from a vector originating in A and perpendicular to AB and AC
  # Here, we calculate the displacement of the ethylene from the benzene ring center
  pp: point_normal(%molecule(2); %molecule(1); 1; 5)
