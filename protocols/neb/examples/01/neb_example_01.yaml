# Minimum energy path optimization for rotation of bond in propane molecule

job: neb

# The initial series of geometries was built by interpolating z-matrices of
# an initial and rotated state
geometry: propane_scan.xyz

# Force constant connecting the images - it controls the spacing of the points
# along the MEP but the calculation is not very sensitive to it
neb_fconst: 10.0

# Optimize also the initial and final state - can be disabled if the geometries
# had been optimized already
neb_optimize_endpoints: yes

# Calculate four images in parallel
cuby_threads: 4

calculation:
  interface: mopac
  method: pm6
  charge: 0
