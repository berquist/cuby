# The following multistep calculates interaction energy in water dimer
# using PM6 with various versions of dispersion and H-bond corrections.

job: multistep

# Step names must be defined first
steps: pm6, pm6-dh2, pm6-dh+, pm6-d3h4

# Large part of the setup is the same for all the steps. It is put into
# the common block which is used in each step (any settings here can be
# overriden in the step block)

  # Default PM6 calculation from calculation_common is used,
