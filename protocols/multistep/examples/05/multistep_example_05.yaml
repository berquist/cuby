# Multistep protocol example 5 - parallelization
#===============================================================================

# This is a copy of Example 1 with added paralellization. Only the commented
# keywords were added.

# Steps that do not depend on each other can be calculated in parallel.
# The number of parallel processes is set globally:
cuby_threads: 4

job: multistep
steps: pm6, pm6-dh2, pm6-dh+, pm6-d3h4

calculation_common:
  job: interaction
  geometry: S66:01
  interface: mopac
  method: pm6
  charge: 0
  molecule_a:
    charge: 0
  molecule_b:
    charge: 0

calculation_pm6:
# The following keyword (applied also to the following steps) queues this step
# until 1) all steps are queued, or 2) a step which does not have this flag is 
# encountered. Then, the queue is executed and results are printed in the
# original order.
  step_queue: yes

calculation_pm6-dh2:
  mopac_corrections: dh2
  step_queue: yes # queue this step as well

calculation_pm6-dh+:
  mopac_corrections: dh+
  step_queue: yes # queue this step as well

calculation_pm6-d3h4:
  step_title: "PM6-D3H4 - not in Mopac, using modifiers in Cuby"
# Do not queue this step. When this step is encountered, all the previously
# queued steps are executed before this step is executed.
