<p>
This protocol allows chaining more calculations (steps) in one input file. Compared to running a series of calculation from outside of cuby, there are multiple advantages:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Part of the input can be shared by all the steps (see Example 1)</li>
	<li>A step can be executed conditionally (see Example 2)</li>
	<li>The results from the steps can be automatically processed at the end of the calculation (see Examples 3 and 4)</li>
	<li>Parallel and serial execution of the steps can be mixed arbitrarily (see Example 5)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Output</h2>
<p>
The output of a serial calculation and a parallel one (where steps queued using the keyword <a href="keywords.html#step_queue">step_queue</a>)
might differ in some cases. When teh steps are executed in series, the step header is printed and all output from this step follows.
When a step is queued, the step header and final result is printed only after it is finished. However, some of its output (e.g. from the preparation
of the jobs, or output from its parts taht must be executed serially, e.g. the individual cycles of optimization) are printed earlier.
