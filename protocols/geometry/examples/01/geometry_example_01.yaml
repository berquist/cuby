# Geometry protocol example 1 - standard geometry manipulations
#===============================================================================

# This example shows processing the input geometry using the manipulations that
# can be applied to any geometry loaded into cuby. These are controleld by
# keywords:
# * selection
# * reorder
# * rotate
# * update_coordinates

# Here, the input geometry is loaded from the S66 data set and only the first
# molecule from the dimer is saved in PDB format.

job: geometry
geometry: S66:01 # water_dimer
selection: "1-3"
geometry_write: water1.pdb
