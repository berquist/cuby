# Geometry protocol example 3 - build water dimer using connectors
#===============================================================================

# This is example of a multi-step job that build two water molecules
# wuith connectors and connects them.

job: multistep
steps: mono1, mono2, connect

calculation_mono1: # Build monomer 1 with connector on O
  job: geometry
  geometry: |
    O    0.000000000   0.000000000   0.000000000
    H   -0.583458892  -0.762495884   0.000000000
    H   -0.583837701   0.762495884  -0.000000000
  geometry_action: add_connector
  geometry_write: water_O.xyz
  # Connector on O, perpendicular to molecular plane
  connector_type: perpendicular
  # Selection to the atom to connect to, the other two atoms define the plane:
  connector_orientation: "1; 2; 3"

calculation_mono2: # Build monomer 2 with connector on H
  job: geometry

    O    0.000000000   0.000000000   0.000000000

  geometry_action: add_connector
  geometry_write: water_H.xyz
  # Connector on H, in extension of the bond
  connector_type: linear
  # Selection to the atom to connect to, second selection defines the angle
  # and the third one a plane:
  connector_orientation: "2; 1; 3"

calculation_connect:
  job: geometry
  geometry: water_O.xyz
  geometry2: water_H.xyz
  # Connect the connectors
  geometry_action: connect
  # The molecules point to opposite sides from the axis:
  geometry_connect_orientation: max_center_dist
  # In addition, build a scan of geometries bith intermolecular distance
  # scaled by these factors:
  geometry_connect_scan_vdw: [0.8, 0.85, 0.9, 0.95, 1.0, 1.05, 1.1, 1.25, 1.5, 2.0]
