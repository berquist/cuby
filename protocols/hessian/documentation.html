<p>
This protocol calculates and prints Hessian, the matrix of second derivatives of the energy. By default, it also writes it to a file that can be used as an input for the calculation of <a href="protocol_frequencies.html">vibrational frequencies</a>. Translational and rotational degrees of freedom are <a href="keywords.html#hessian_projected">projected out</a> from the calculated Hessian.
