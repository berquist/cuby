# Reaction protocol example 2: multi-step calculation
#===============================================================================

# This example features the same reaction as example 1 to for each compound,
# a multi-step calculation is applied

job: reaction
reaction_formula: 2 H2 + O2 -> 2 H2O

reaction_geometries:
  H2: h2.xyz
  O2: o2.xyz
  H2O: h2o.xyz

calculation:
  # Multi-step protocol is used
  job: multistep
  multistep_print: no
  steps: opt, energy

  # First step - geometry optimization
  # Geometry is taken from parent block, it is the 'calculation' level

    job: optimize
    optimize_print: "" # Disable printing of optimization steps
    interface: dftb

  # Second step: energy calculation
  # The geometry is taken from the previous step, it is after the optimization
