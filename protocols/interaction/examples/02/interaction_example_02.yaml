#===============================================================================
# Interaction energy calculation example 2 - manual setup, parallelization
#===============================================================================

# The same calculation as in Example 1, this time with manual specification
# of all necessary input

job: interaction
bsse_correction: yes # Enable counterpoise correction of BSSE
geometry: S66:water_dimer # Water dimer from the S66 data set

# Definition of the monomers
# In this case it is optional, it is necessary in following cases:
# 1) Autodetection of monomers fails, e.g. when they are too close
# 2) Charges of the monomers are not 0
# 3) Multiplicities of the monomers are not 1
molecule_a:
  selection: "1-3"
  charge: 0
  multiplicity: 1
molecule_b:
  selection: "4-6"
  charge: 0
  multiplicity: 1

# Calculation
interface: psi4
method: MP2
basisset: cc-pVTZ

# Parallelization - the three calculations can be ran simultaneously
cuby_threads: 3
