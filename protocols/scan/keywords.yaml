# Keywords for protocol Scan
################################################################################

keywords: 
  :scan_generator: !ruby/object:SettingsKeyword
    convert_to: :symbol
    when_not_present: :default
    default_value: :none
    allowed_values:
      - :none
      - :grid_xyz
  #: By default, the scan is performed on a series of geometries provided
  #: by the user. The scan generator can be used to generate this series
  #: on the fly.

  :scan_generator_setup: !ruby/object:SettingsKeyword
    convert_to: :hash
    when_not_present: :default
    default_value: {}
  #: Setup for the scan generator. Different options are available for different
  #: generators, see the protocol documentation.

  :scan_generator_batchsize: !ruby/object:SettingsKeyword
    convert_to: :integer
    when_not_present: :default
    default_value: 0
  #: When set to 0 (default), a series of geometries is saved in a single file and
  #: immediately calculated. If set to nonzero number, the scan is divided into
  #: batches of this size which are saved in separate directories so that they can
  #: be run independently.

  :scan_mode: !ruby/object:SettingsKeyword
    convert_to: :symbol
    when_not_present: :default
    default_value: :parallel
    allowed_values:
      - :serial
      - :parallel
  #: In the default (parallel) mode, all calculations of teh scan are prepared
  #: and then run using the internal queue system of cuby, which can run
  #: multiple calculations in parallel. In the serial mode, only one
  #: calculation is set up and repeatedly called with the changing geometries.

  :scan_print_mode: !ruby/object:SettingsKeyword
    convert_to: :symbol
    when_not_present: :default
    default_value: :simple
    allowed_values:
      - :numbers
      - :simple
      - :full
  #: Mode of printing scan results:
  #* numbers - just a column(s) of numbers are printed
  #* simple - one result per line, with some description
  #* full - Verbose output from the child protocol. Only this option is available for all protocols.

  :geometry_template: !ruby/object:SettingsKeyword
    convert_to: :string
    when_not_present: other
  #: Template geometry into which the coordinates specified by the geometry keyword are loaded.
  #: This is an optional feature, when not set, the actual geometry is used directly.
