# Forcefield calculation of rotation profile of a C-C bond in a model peptide

job: scan

# The forcefield calculation requires a geometry in PDB format. However, the
# scan protocol works with .xyz format which can contain multiple frames more
# easily. The solution is to provide a template PDB into which the actual
# coordinates from .xyz scan are loaded
geometry_template: ace-ala-nme.pdb

# The coordinates from the following file are loaded into the template
geometry: scan.xyz

# Scan mode - serial/parallel
scan_mode: parallel
cuby_threads: 4 # four calculations run simultaneously

# The calculation performed on each geometry
calculation:
  job: energy
  interface: amber
  charge: 0
